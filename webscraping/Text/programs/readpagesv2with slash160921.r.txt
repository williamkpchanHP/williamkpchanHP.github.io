# next improvement is to read a list of addrs and show 20 pages and wait for a key press to continue
# further improvement is to read the page and locate the img link
# further improvement is to read the addr and write the web page and call it
# further to tailor made for automating specific addr type to chop the diff parts
# eg to chop the pink ftv addr, read addr, remove thumb,replace full, strip numbers and ext.
# eg. to read the next btn
