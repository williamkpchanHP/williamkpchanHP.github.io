Coding a color guessing game with JavaScript is quite straightforward:

<ol><li>You build a game where the player will see a single RGB value for a color. 
The player has to click on a color they think matches the RGB value displayed.</li></ol>You can easily add more features to the game to make it more difficult. 

For example, you could limit the number of guesses or give the player three &ldquo;lives&rdquo;. With every wrong guess, they would lose one, and the game would be over when they run out of lives.

Building a Hangman game is one of the best JavaScript project ideas for beginners who want a bit of a challenge. 

If you&rsquo;re not familiar, the hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over.

Although the gameplay may sound simple, you need to consider a few critical elements in your JavaScript code:

Set a maximum limit for guesses.
Display the remaining number of guesses to the player.
Provide the player with an interface to input their guesses.
This beginner JavaScript project will probably take you a bit longer, but it&rsquo;s great practice. You will need to think about random choice, variables, boolean values, inputs and outputs, strings, lengths, and more.

<h3>7: JavaScript Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<img class="lazy" src="https://mikkegoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Build-your-own-JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe-game.png" alt="Build your own JavaScript Tic Tac Toe game" class="wp-image-6751" data-pin-description="Are you looking for fun JavaScript projects for beginners to practice your coding skills?

Building a simple Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript is another excellent project idea you can finish in a single day.

You will create a 3&times;3 grid where two players will take turns marking the grid with cross and circle symbols. The first player to get three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Although the game seems simple, you need to figure out how to create the logic that follows the game rules in JavaScript. 

Hence, before you start writing any code, break down the flow of the game into logical steps first. 

For a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, I find it helpful to draw a small flow chart to visualize the different outcomes of the game. When I can see the flow on paper, it&rsquo;s easier to start writing actual code.

<a aria-label="You will find an example Tic Tac Toe JavaScript project here. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://codepen.io/daajust/pen/obVROB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You will find an example Tic Tac Toe JavaScript project with its source code here.</a>

<h3>8: JavaScript Pong Game</h3>

Pong was one of my favorite video games back in the day! 

Did you know that it was the very first commercially successful video game ever? 

Building the game in JavaScript takes some work, but the end results can is tons of fun to play. 

Again, start by thinking about the rules of the game and map out the different events your code needs to cover. 

As you build the game, you will probably come up with a few ideas on how to make it more fun.

Also, you may want to create different difficulty levels for your game. For example:

The ball could move faster after a given number of rounds
To make things trickier for the player, allow for the computer to move the paddle more quickly
Pong is a rather complex project if you are entirely new to JavaScript. I think the most difficult part of this project idea is to make sure the computer doesn&rsquo;t always win. 

Hence, make sure you have a couple of easier projects under your belt before tackling this one.

Coding a JavaScript memory matching game or pairs game is another fun project you can build for fun (and for your portfolio!).

The logic of the game is simple:

<ol><li>There are a given number of cards on the table facing down.
The player needs to find all the pairs.</li></ol>However, you may want to add more difficulty by limiting the number of guesses or by setting a time limit for the game to be finished.

This is another great project for practicing not just your JavaScript skills but your HTML and CSS, too. 

The easiest way to create the matching cards is to put different colors on them that the player needs to match. But you can also use images, icons, or numbers, for example.

I was a huge fan of drawing my own maze games when I was a kid in the early &rsquo;90s. Therefore, learning how to code my own maze with JavaScript was so much fun. 

As for the difficulty of this JavaScript project, it is somewhat more demanding. 

Thus, if you are just getting started, make sure you feel comfortable enough with the language before you start building this game.

Calculating tips can be tricky sometimes &ndash; especially after a long day of coding. 

If you want to save the trouble of calculating your tips manually, just build your own tip calculator you can use whenever, wherever. Plus, this tool never makes mistakes or errors in calculations.

When you&rsquo;ve built a simple tip calculator, you can always add more features to make it more user-friendly. 

For instance, let&rsquo;s say you want to travel abroad soon. Find out what&rsquo;s an appropriate tip level there and add a country selection option to your calculator.

JavaScript is a wonderful tool for coding dynamic, interactive lists where users can add, edit, delete, and move items. It&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t achieve with just HTML and CSS.

If you are anything like me, you have a running list of seemingly never-ending to-dos:

Dealing with e-mails
Managing projects
Learning new things
Maintaining your portfolio
Knowing what groceries to buy
Places to visit on your next holiday
Movies to watch on Netflix
To make your life easier, you can build your own custom-coded to-do list as a JavaScript project right away. Start small and create a single list where you can simply add and delete items. 

As your skills improve, you can add new features to help you manage your to-dos more efficiently. 

For instance, you could use multiple lists next to each other to categorize your to-dos. 

A particularly handy feature would be to enable a drag-and-drop feature for moving to-dos between the different lists and columns.

If you want to become a front-end web developer, a custom-made JavaScript timeline can be a great feature for building websites for freelance clients, for instance. Businesses and start-ups often want to display their most significant milestones on their website.

Also, you can use the code from your JS timeline for other similar applications. 

For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to break down important steps into bite-sized portions for your website visitors. You can alter the timeline code to display small bits of a specific story or piece of content to your readers without overwhelming them with too much information at once.

Everybody loves a good quiz! Luckily, building a small quiz with JavaScript is quite easy &ndash; and they can be super helpful. 

If you want to make money freelancing, you can build a portfolio website to showcase your projects. Use a quiz on the site to help potential clients find the right services for their problems, for example.

Or, if you blog about coding<em> (go you!)</em>, you can help your readers find the right resources and articles based on what they want to learn. 

Simply create a small quiz to determine what their goals are and direct them to tutorials and blog posts to help them get started.

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to code your own mini code editor in JavaScript? I think this is a cool project idea for beginners!

Here are a few ideas for additional features for your code editor:

Use CSS for syntax highlighting
